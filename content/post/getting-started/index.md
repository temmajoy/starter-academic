## Overview

The 100% Soil-Healthy Farming Bill will establish soil-health goals and create financial incentives for farmers. It is currently being considered in the Minnesota House and Senate and we need all the support we can get! Only three percent of Minnesota cropland is planted with cover crops, which help prevent agricultural runoff and nutrient depletion. When farmers are given resources to adopt sustainable practices, like cover crops, they can build and sustain healthy communities. If passed, the bill will:

• Protect against extreme weather and sequester carbon
• Prioritize BIPOC and small to midsized farmers
• Foster healthy ecosystems to maintain clean water, and benefit pollinators, wildlife, and people.
