I graduated from Carleton College with a degree in Political Science and Environmental Studies. Within my degree, I explored the relationship between effective policy implementation and inclusionary strategies. I also investigated the difficulties of implementing climate mitigation strategies in a rapidly changing economic, political, and technological climate. Above all, I find meaning in my work when I effectively convey it to others and when I help people assist their community. Through my Congressional work, Environmental Fellowship, and Volunteering, I have continued to do what I believe is most important—providing valuable policy information and resources to community members who want to take action on local issues. Outside of my outreach and research work, I am happiest outdoors: running, hiking, canoeing, gardening, or reading a good book.
